# Robot-Modeling

Robotics toolbox and within that SerialLink Library is a must for this code to run in MATLAB. Preferably 2018 version MATLAB.

Trajectory is obtained by specifying initial and final joint angles and by using SerialLinkâ€™s optimal path selection algorithm.
This code draws the path taken by the manipulator.
